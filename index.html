        <h2 class="subtitle">A Brief Overview of Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Primary Mission:
          Our primary mission, as required, is to successfully and safely land the CanSat, as well as take measurements
          for air temperature and pressure.
          Secondary Mission:
          Our secondary mission aims to give us qualitative evidence about the suitability of a location for sustained
          human life, by providing analysis regarding the atmosphere of a location and the geography of a location, such
          as the availability of water and vegetation. This will be almost entirely software based, retrieving the local
          storage from the CanSat, and then plugging the information into a custom-built program for picture analysis.
